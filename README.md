Phone Book Application ver-2

This program models a phone book where you can add contacts,search the contacts by the name,and add addresses to the data which can be attached to a name.
For simplicity's sake, the functionality for saving to file has been removed.


NB:This is my solution for one of the exercises from the Advanced course in programming by CS department,Uni Helsinki.
